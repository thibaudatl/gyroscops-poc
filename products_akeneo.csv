25904123;camcorders;"<b>Optical SteadyShot™ with Intelligent Active Mode</b><br>
<br>
Advanced image stabilisation keeps footage blur-free, even when the recording circumstances or the user's hands are shaky.<br>
<br>
<b>Up to 26.8mm wide-angle lens</b><br>
<br>
Whether you’re shooting movies or still images, the class-leading wide angle lens can help you capture more of landscapes shots and indoor scenes, when you don't have enough room to step back. Even without a wide conversion lens, selected camcorders shoot as wide as 26.8mm1 (16:9 aspect ratio) in movie mode.<br>
<br>
<b>Exceptional image quality</b><br>
<br>
The high-bitrate XAVC S format is for videographers ready to take their work to the next level. Delivering incredible quality, XAVC S is built from the XAVC format used by professional filmmakers and broadcasters, while employing intelligent data compression to export consumer-friendly file sizes.<br>
<br>
<b>Highlight Movie Maker</b><br>
<br>
A versatile tool to streamline movie editing, Highlight Movie Maker offers several time-saving features. Add highlight markers to key moments while recording, and let the software automatically sync your transitions to your chosen soundtrack.<br>
<br>
<b>Motion Shot Video</b><br>
<br>
Motion Shot Video plays a sequence of superimposed images that trace recorded action in split-second intervals for you to analyse in detail. During playback, you can adjust the interval, or pause to capture and share a still image.<br>
<br>
<b>Built-in USB cable</b><br>
<br>
The built-in USB cable stowed in the hand strap is very convenient for extra-quick charging and connection to a PC, so there is no need to pack a bulky extra USB cable or AC adapter. For charging without a PC, use a compact AC-USB adapter (optional).<br>
<br>
<b>Exmor R™ CMOS sensor</b><br>
<br>
This large, cutting-edge sensor enhances image clarity, reduces noise in dark environments, and enables soft background defocusing.<br>
<br>
<b>BIONZ X™ image processor</b><br>
<br>
The advanced BIONZ X™ image processing engine helps achieve more naturally vivid and lifelike image quality as well as faster processing capabilities.<br>
<br>
<b>ZEISS lens</b><br>
<br>
Sharing a commitment to outstanding performance and design, Sony and Carl Zeiss co-develop lenses that combine the best possible optics with premium-quality electronics and sensor technology for Sony’s Handycam® models.<br>
<br>
<b>9.2MP still image capture</b><br>
<br>
Sometimes you don’t need — or want — video. Put your video camera in still image mode and capture amazing high-quality 9.2-megapixel single images as easily as you do with a still image camera.<br>
<br>
<b>Progressive Recording</b><br>
<br>
Clear movies, that contain twice the image data of movies recorded in interlace mode, can be recorded in Full HD at 60p/50p in progressive recording mode. The images are as smooth as those shot at 60/50 frames per second, and each frame is recorded as one full picture. So a still captured from a movie recorded in progressive mode looks extra-sharp.<br>
<br>
<b>Dual Video Recording2</b><br>
<br>
Record two movies at the same time — one in the maximum-quality XAVC S or AVCHD format and another in MP4 format. That way you’ve got a small file ready for instant sharing, plus a professional-grade file for further editing.<br>
<br>
<b>Dual Record mode</b><br>
<br>
Dual Record mode enables you to shoot HD video and high-resolution still images simultaneously to capture the best shot in both ways.3<br>
<br>
<b>Face Detection4</b><br>
<br>
This automatically optimises focus, exposure, and colour for best results. Select someone to be prioritised simply by touching their face on the LCD display, which is useful for selecting a key person when shooting at a crowded event. Even if the subject leaves the frame, they will be remembered and prioritised upon re-entering the scene.<br>
<br>
<b>Intelligent Auto</b><br>
<br>
This feature automatically determines the type of scene being shot and optimises a combination of settings from three groups (Face, Scene, Camera shake). It provides the best results for up to 1805 scene types, even at night and in backlit scenes. Selected settings are displayed as icons on the LCD screen for easy reference.<br>
<br>
<b>Smile Shutter4</b><br>
<br>
Because great smiles are fleeting, this feature ensures they’re never lost. Automatically capture snapshots of smiling faces, even while recording video.<br>
<br>
<b>Event Browse</b><br>
<br>
For easy browsing and playback, this Handycam® plays back GUI group videos and still images that have been recorded as separate events. You can choose from different display schemes from event view or index view as needed, for better organisation, searching, viewing, and sharing of your personal content.<br>
<br>
<b>Picture Effect</b><br>
<br>
Give free reign to your imagination. Picture Effect expands movie and photo enjoyment by letting you add up to seven creative effects (Partial Color, Retro Photo, Soft High-key, High Contrast Mono, Toy Camera, Pop Color, Posterization) without troublesome editing on a computer.<br>
<br>
<b>Manual settings for iris and shutter speed</b><br>
<br>
This camcorder gives you freedom to choose manual settings for iris and shutter speed control when shooting under backlit and underexposed conditions, as well as in other situations.<br>
<br>
<b>Dual memory card compatibility</b><br>
<br>
This Handycam® has slots for Memory Stick Micro™ and Micro SD/SDHC cards, so you can conveniently record to whichever one is more readily available.<br>
<br>
<b>PlayMemories™ Home6</b><br>
<br>
With PlayMemories™ Home software installed on a computer7, it’s easy to import footage from a Handycam® camcorder to view, edit, print, share via the web, burn files on to a disc, and even create a multi-view movie with a simultaneous split-screen view of up to four selected clips.<br>
